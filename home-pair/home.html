            <p>Hi. I'm Michael and this is my website. Here you can navigate through different aspects of my life including my favorite food and drink, my experiences relating to projects and leadership, and my educational background.</p>
            <p>My favorite food is pizza. You can see a video of exactly what kind of pizza I like and from where.</p>
